I need you to help me implement the full code for my project using Claude Code. Start by reading the PLANNING.md and ai-doc-system_architect.md files to understand the project architecture, goals, and constraints.


Here are specific guidelines I want you to follow:


Project Awareness

Begin by examining PLANNING.md to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints
Check TASK.md to identify pending tasks, and add new tasks with descriptions and today's date if needed
Maintain consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns as specified in PLANNING.md



Code Implementation

Keep files under 500 lines of code - split into modules when approaching this limit
Organize code into clearly separated modules grouped by feature or responsibility
Use clear, consistent imports (prefer relative imports within packages)
Add inline "# Reason:" comments for complex logic to explain the rationale



Task Management

Mark completed tasks in TASK.md after finishing them
Add newly discovered sub-tasks to TASK.md under a "Discovered During Work" section
Update README.md when adding features, changing dependencies, or modifying setup steps
Comment non-obvious code so it's understandable to a mid-level developer



Implementation Approach

Don't assume missing context - ask me questions if you're uncertain
Only use known, verified Python packages - never hallucinate libraries or functions
Confirm file paths and module names exist before referencing them
Never delete or overwrite existing code unless instructed or if it's part of a task in TASK.md



Please start by analyzing the current project files and give me a clear implementation plan. Let's approach this systematically by breaking down the implementation into manageable steps.
